# EvilTwinAttackDetection
Train machine learning algorithms, SVM with RBF Kernel and NN, on AWID3 dataset to detect evil twin attacks. 

The 2023 paper ”Analysis and Identification of Evil Twin Attack through Data Science Techniques Using AWID3 Dataset” by da Silva et al. examines the potential of machine learning algorithms as a force against these attacks, being trained on the latest edition of the Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion Dataset (AWID3)( [1]) to detect abnormal and suspicious network data that likely signifies the presence of an evil twin. Algorithms ranged from 85.658% to 99.338% accuracy in identifying evil twin-related network traffic. This paper expanded on the work done by da Silva et al. by contributing an additional execution of this concept with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Neural Network (NN). Results indicate that SVM with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel achieved an accuracy of 98.93% with a recall of 100%, while the Neural Network achieved an accuracy of 99.04% with a recall of 100%.
